# Additional Biodiversity Metrics for Enhanced eDNA Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document outlines additional biodiversity metrics that could significantly enhance the current eDNA analysis pipeline beyond the currently implemented metrics (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, observed OTUs, PERMANOVA, and PCoA). These additional metrics would provide deeper ecological insights, improved statistical power, and more comprehensive biodiversity assessments.

## Currently Implemented Metrics
